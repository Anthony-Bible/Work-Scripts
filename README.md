# Work-Scripts
Scripts that I have found useful in work especially with automation


## txtwire.py

Download a csv file from txtwire.com for a specific client

## Install.bat
This script gets the computer ready for the next user. It starts off by checking the architecture of the computer copies over important configuration files from an always updated location to the correct directory based off the architecture. It also restarts the logging service in case it was stopped for any reason. 

## HailMary.sh
This script is created to work on proxmox 5.1. THis script is intended to automate the switching over process in case of a node failure. In case of a node failure it is important to not spend time on figuring out commands and trying start the servers manually. Some notes, this starts the guests as if it didn't turn off, this means running the script while you have another host running will cause quite a few problems. In addition this script doesn't correct quorum, so if it is expecting more than what is available you will run into errors. 


##Zip-Encrypt-SFTP.bat
This script zips all files according to a specific regex. Then it encrypts each zip file with GPG and finally uploads the files via putty scp. The script uses passwords in the upload because it was given as a parameter to our project, in theory a better and more secure option would be to use a key file and restrict access to the key file to only those who need it. 

To help anonymize our clients and obsucre our internal network infrastrastrure I have renamed certain items, like folders and clients. I have also generalized commands like the sftp upload to prevent unauthorized use of the credentials. In a production enviornment you would customize the options to properly upload
